# simple_Password

This Python code for a simple password generator works by creating a list of characters that can be used to generate the password. This list of characters can include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and special symbols.

Once the list of characters has been created, the code generates a random password by randomly selecting characters from the list. The length of the password is determined by the length parameter.
